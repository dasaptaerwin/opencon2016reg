__Describe yourself in 1-2 sentences.__
_Maximum 280 characters (~40 words)._ It's up to you what information to provide. Many people write something similar to their Twitter or Facebook bio.

>I'm a lecturer/researcher in hydrogeology. I work mainly with hydrochemical dataset and I support open science.

Why are you interested in Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data and how does it relate to your work? If you are already involved in these issues, tell us how. There are many reasons why Open is important. This question is asking specifically why Open is important to *you*. Please use your own words to describe your perspective and experience. _Maximum 1600 characters (~250 words)._

>I am interested in Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data because I believe those policies' will attract more collaborations. We need more collaborations in Indonesia to gather more knowledge, research culture, and research impact. In my perspective science should be done in openly manner for it to be reproduced, replicated, and reviewed. Good science is not valued  solely based on the quality of the analysis and interpretation, but also how it is disseminated to the community and how the community could use it for their own interests. 
>I have several experiences in starting national and international collaborations based on open dataset, for example: nutrient analysis of sea water samples in closed bay system with Septriono Nugroho from Research Center of Marine Geology, hydrochemical analysis of water sample in Bandung area with Dr. Willem Vervoort from University of Sydney and the water quality analysis related to public health status in Bandung area with Dr. Kingsley Agho from The University of Western Sydney.    
>In the university level, I have given several workshops on open data and open source tools (in this case R programming and Zotero reference manager) to students and fellow lecturers. The response is good, but I need to reach for more audience in various fields of study in my university. 

The biggest goal of OpenCon is to catalyze action. What ideas do you have for advancing Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data, and how would you use your experience at OpenCon to have an impact? _Maximum 1600 characters (~250 words)._

>My ideas for advancing Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data in my university as well as in Indonesia are: 
1. to nurture the open research attitude by organising more workshops for students and lectures in various university. I need to build their perspective of `research sharing` not `research owning` and by sharing it, all parties will get more sustainable research impact; 
2. to promote open infrastructure by setting up an open thesis/dissertation repository in my university as a prototype or using more open source platform as sharing media. Choosing the right and low-cost media is very crucial with our low research budget. Collaborating with currently available services are also my options, for instance: The Winnower and RIOJournal; 
3. to initiate a set of open science regulation in the university scope and national scope. This is very important to force the academia to openly share their research results to get more attention and online visibility and in time to get more impact in form of citation and research collaboration.  

>My participation in OpenCon2016 will surely enrich my knowledge and skill in order to implement my above working plan. 

For the events you checked, please explain how you participated and/or how you plan to participate. _Maximum 600 characters (~100 words)._

>For my `Open Data Day` event, I will launch the result of our research in our open data platform. In this event also, I will publish our first ITB-Zenodo Open Data Community.

> I'm working on the following open data projects: multivariate analysis on geothermal water dataset (grant: Institut Teknologi Bandung) and open groundwater data set (grant: Ministry of Higher Education). On both projects we are using: OSF with the additional QGIS Cloud  to store and present the spatial coordinates and Github for the R codes.
> I have endorsed open science policy in all of my publications, since 2014, by hosting the dataset on Figshare or Zenodo and cite it in the main paper. This year I am trying to submit my dataset as "data paper" as my next implementation of open science.   
> In my class, I endorse open science by setting up an open repository for handouts and class projects.
> My future project will be setting up our institution's thesis database as open repo for easy access and citations.
> My participation on OpenCon will support my on going and future activities.
